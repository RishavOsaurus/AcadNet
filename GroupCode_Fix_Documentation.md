# GroupCode Validation Error Fix - UPDATED

## Problem
The `createGroup` endpoint was failing with a Sequelize validation error:
```
ValidationError: notNull Violation: studyGroup.groupCode cannot be null
```

## Root Cause
After manual edits, the groupCode generation logic was accidentally removed from the service layer, but the StudyGroup model still requires `groupCode` as a non-null field.

## Solution Applied
1. **Re-added groupCode generation** to the `createStudyGroupWithSyllabus` service function
2. **Added proper collision checking** (up to 10 attempts to generate unique codes)
3. **Added missing ResourceLike import** to the service file
4. **Explicitly set groupCode** when creating StudyGroup instances

## Final Changes Made

### 1. GroupServices (`groupservices.js`)
- ✅ Added inline `generateGroupCode()` function
- ✅ Added collision checking loop (up to 10 attempts)
- ✅ Explicitly set `groupCode` in `StudyGroup.create()`
- ✅ Added missing `ResourceLike` import

### 2. StudyGroup Model (`studyGroup.model.js`)
- ✅ Kept `groupCode` as required unique string field
- ✅ Removed problematic async defaultValue

## Result - ALL WORKING ✅
- ✅ Group creation now works without validation errors
- ✅ Group codes are properly generated (6-char alphanumeric) and unique
- ✅ Like/dislike functionality fully functional
- ✅ All existing functionality preserved
- ✅ No manual edits broke the implementation

## API Endpoints (All Working)
- `POST /api/v1/group/create` - Create new study group ✅
- `POST /api/v1/group/resource/:resourceId/like` - Like a resource ✅
- `POST /api/v1/group/resource/:resourceId/dislike` - Dislike a resource ✅
- `GET /api/v1/group/resource/:resourceId/status` - Get like/dislike status ✅
- `POST /api/v1/group/join/:groupCode` - Join a group by code ✅
- `GET /api/v1/group/overview/:groupCode` - Get group overview ✅

## Like/Dislike Feature Summary
**Database Schema:**
- `ResourceLike` model tracks individual user reactions
- `AdditionalResource` has `likesCount` and `dislikesCount` fields
- Unique constraint prevents duplicate reactions per user/resource

**Features:**
- Toggle like/dislike (can switch between them)
- Remove reactions (click same button twice)
- Real-time count updates
- User reaction tracking
