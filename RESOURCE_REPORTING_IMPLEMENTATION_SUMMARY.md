# Resource Reporting API Implementation Summary

## Overview
Successfully implemented a backend API that allows group members to report inappropriate resources. When a resource is reported, its status changes from 'approved' to 'pending', requiring admin review.

## ✅ Backend Implementation Complete

### 1. New Service Function (`backend/services/groupservices.js`)
- **`reportResource(userId, groupCode, resourceId, reportData)`**
- Validates user permissions (must be group member)
- Prevents self-reporting of resources
- Prevents duplicate reports
- Creates user report record
- Changes resource status from 'approved' to 'pending'
- Uses database transactions for consistency

### 2. New Controller Function (`backend/controllers/groupcontroller.js`)
- **`reportResourceController`**
- Validates request data and reason codes
- Handles error responses
- Returns structured JSON responses

### 3. New API Route (`backend/routes/grouprouter.js`)
- **`POST /:groupCode/resources/:resourceId/report`**
- Requires authentication and CSRF protection
- Accessible to all group members

## ✅ Frontend Integration Complete

### 1. API Service Function (`frontend/src/services/UserServices.tsx`)
- **`reportResourceAPI(groupCode, resourceId, reportData)`**
- Handles HTTP requests to the backend
- Returns structured response data

### 2. React Components (`frontend/src/components/ResourceReportingComponents.tsx`)
- **`ReportResourceModal`**: Full-featured modal for reporting resources
- **`ResourceListItemWithReport`**: Enhanced resource list item with report button
- **`GroupResourcesPageExample`**: Example integration in resource listing
- **Utility functions**: Permission checking and error handling

### 3. Test Suite (`frontend/src/tests/ResourceReportingAPI.test.ts`)
- Comprehensive test functions for all scenarios
- Error case testing
- Usage examples and integration patterns

## ✅ Key Features

### Security & Validation
- ✅ **Authentication Required**: Only authenticated users can report
- ✅ **Group Membership**: Only group members can report resources
- ✅ **Anti-Self-Report**: Users cannot report their own resources
- ✅ **Duplicate Prevention**: Users cannot report the same resource twice
- ✅ **CSRF Protection**: All requests protected against CSRF attacks
- ✅ **Input Validation**: Reason codes and descriptions validated

### Functional Behavior
- ✅ **Status Change**: Reported resources change from 'approved' to 'pending'
- ✅ **Immediate Effect**: Resources are hidden from public view when reported
- ✅ **Admin Review**: Resources appear in admin's pending approval list
- ✅ **Audit Trail**: Complete record of who reported what and why
- ✅ **User Report Integration**: Links with existing user reporting system

### User Experience
- ✅ **User-Friendly Interface**: Modal-based reporting with clear options
- ✅ **Reason Categories**: Predefined reasons for consistent reporting
- ✅ **Optional Description**: Users can provide additional context
- ✅ **Immediate Feedback**: Toast notifications for success/error states
- ✅ **Permission-Based UI**: Report buttons only show when appropriate

## ✅ API Endpoint Details

### Request Format
```http
POST /api/group/:groupCode/resources/:resourceId/report
Content-Type: application/json
Authorization: Bearer <token>
X-CSRF-Token: <csrf_token>

{
  "reason": "offensive_content",
  "description": "This resource contains inappropriate material"
}
```

### Response Format
```json
{
  "success": true,
  "message": "Resource reported successfully. The resource has been marked as pending review.",
  "resourceId": 123,
  "fileName": "document.pdf",
  "reportId": 456,
  "status": "pending"
}
```

### Valid Reason Codes
- `inappropriate_behavior`
- `harassment`
- `spam`
- `offensive_content`
- `violation_of_rules`
- `fake_profile`
- `academic_dishonesty`
- `other`

## ✅ Error Handling

### Client-Side Errors (4xx)
- **400 Bad Request**: Invalid reason, self-reporting attempt
- **403 Forbidden**: Not a group member
- **404 Not Found**: Group or resource not found
- **409 Conflict**: Resource already reported by this user

### Server-Side Errors (5xx)
- **500 Internal Server Error**: Database or file system errors

## ✅ Integration Points

### With Existing Systems
1. **User Authentication**: Uses existing JWT token system
2. **Group Membership**: Integrates with existing membership validation
3. **User Reports**: Creates records in existing user_reports table
4. **Admin Workflow**: Reported resources appear in existing admin panel
5. **Resource Management**: Uses existing resource approval/rejection system

### Database Changes
- **AdditionalResource**: Status field changes from 'approved' to 'pending'
- **UserReport**: New report record with special format for resource reports

## ✅ Usage Workflow

### For Regular Users
1. User sees inappropriate resource in group
2. Clicks report button (only visible if they can report)
3. Selects reason and provides optional description
4. Confirms report action
5. Resource immediately disappears from their view
6. Admin is notified via pending resources list

### For Group Admins
1. Receives notification of pending resource
2. Views resource and report details
3. Can either:
   - **Approve**: Restore resource to 'approved' status
   - **Reject**: Permanently delete the resource
4. Report remains in system for audit purposes

## ✅ Documentation Created

1. **RESOURCE_REPORTING_API_DOCUMENTATION.md**: Complete API documentation
2. **NEW_API_DOC.md**: Updated with new endpoint
3. **Test files**: Comprehensive testing examples
4. **Component examples**: Ready-to-use React components

## ✅ Benefits
