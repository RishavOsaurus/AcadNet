# Frontend Route Mismatch Fix - Group Details

## Problem
The frontend was redirecting to `group/details/groupid` but the backend route was expecting `groupCode` instead of `groupId`.

## Solution
Added a new route and controller to handle both scenarios:

### New Route Added
- **`GET /api/v1/group/details/id/:groupId`** - For frontend using group IDs
- **Existing `GET /api/v1/group/details/:groupCode`** - Kept for group codes

## Changes Made

### 1. Routes (`grouprouter.js`)
- ✅ Added new route: `/details/id/:groupId`
- ✅ Imported new controller function `groupDetailsById`
- ✅ Kept existing `/details/:groupCode` route

### 2. Controller (`groupcontroller.js`)
- ✅ Added `groupDetailsById()` function
- ✅ Fixed broken `console` statement in `groupDetails()`
- ✅ Added proper imports for like/dislike service functions

### 3. Services (`groupservices.js`)
- ✅ Added `getGroupDetailsById()` function
- ✅ Includes AdditionalResource with like/dislike counts
- ✅ Includes Syllabus with Topics and SubTopics
- ✅ Includes Creator information

## API Endpoints Available

### Group Details
- `GET /api/v1/group/details/:groupCode` - Get group by code
- `GET /api/v1/group/details/id/:groupId` - Get group by ID ✨ **NEW**

### Like/Dislike (Working)
- `POST /api/v1/group/resource/:resourceId/like`
- `POST /api/v1/group/resource/:resourceId/dislike`
- `GET /api/v1/group/resource/:resourceId/status`

### Other Group Operations
- `POST /api/v1/group/create`
- `GET /api/v1/group/groups`
- `GET /api/v1/group/overview`
- `POST /api/v1/group/join/:groupCode`

## Frontend Integration
Your frontend can now use either:
1. **For Group ID**: `GET /api/v1/group/details/id/{groupId}`
2. **For Group Code**: `GET /api/v1/group/details/{groupCode}`

Both endpoints return group details including:
- Group information (name, description, creator)
- Additional resources with like/dislike counts
- Complete syllabus structure
- All necessary data for the like/dislike UI

## Status: ✅ FULLY WORKING
- Frontend route mismatch resolved
- Like/dislike functionality intact
- All endpoints tested and error-free
